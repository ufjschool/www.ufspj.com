                    <h1>First Ammendement lunch on Thursday March 27</h1>
                    <p>Would you give up your First Amendment rights for a free lunch? Do you know your rights?</p>
                    <p>Join the Society of Professional Journalists in our First Amendment-free country on Plaza of the Americas from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thursday, March 27 for a free lunch on us.</p>
                    <p>That's right - FREE LUNCH!***</p>
                    <p>***All you have to do is sign away your First Amendment rights (symbolically). But who really uses that amendment, anyway? Just terrorists and yellow journalists and flag burners, thatâ€™s who. Screw those guys. Hey, a couple of hours without the First Amendment in exchange for a tasty lunch is a sweet deal for any law-abiding American.</p>
                    <p>Get to Plaza early. Last year we had more than 400 people give up their First Amendment rights.</p>
                    <p>We'll be serving donated food from the Bagel Bakery, Falafel King, The Coop, Satchel's Pizza, Moe's Southwest Grill, Carabba's, and more!</p>
                    <p>Help us break our record and have 500 people get fed and give up their rights!</p>
